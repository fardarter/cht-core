# Example usage of cht-form

To run the example, run the following command from the `./webapp` directory:

```bash
../node_modules/.bin/ng build cht-form
```

This will build the `cht-form` component and place it in the `./webapp/dist` directory.

Open the `./webapp/dist/index.html` file in a browser to see the example.
